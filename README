Program 2 – Erewhon Mobile Data Plans 
 
Erewhon Mobile charges cellular customers a rate based on the total amount of data used by a customer in the billing period. For simplicity, customers are charge based on which range their total data usage falls within. Note, it is not a cumulative charge; your program will figure out which single range the usage falls into, then calculate the cost based on that range’s cost. 
Total Data Usage 	Rate of Charge 
Up to and including 200Mb 	$20.00 flat rate 
Over 200Mb and up to and including 500Mb 	$0.105 per Mb 
Over 500Mb and up to and including 1Gb 	$0.110 per Mb 
Over 1Gb 	$118.00 flat rate 
Then, write a console application to input the customer’s usage in mega/gigabytes and output the corresponding rate and charge.
Your solution must contain examples demonstrating your understanding of appropriate use of functions and core assignment concepts (decision structures).
EXAMPLES AND TESTING 
In the section below you will be presented with at least one screenshot of a successful execution of a sample solution to the program, which should help demonstrate how your input/output on the program should work. In addition to the sample values used in the screenshot(s), additional testing values are given in a chart along with the output values that they should produce. You can expect your instructor to grade your assignment by using all of these listed input values at the very least, but keep in mind that additional values may also be used as well. In other words, you should thoroughly test your code before submitting! 
Sample Output - Make sure your program can output data exactly as shown below. 
Enter data usage (Mb): 250 
Total charge is $26.25 

Other testing values: 
Data Usage 	Total Charge 
175 	$20.00 
436 	$45.78 
2035 	$118.00
